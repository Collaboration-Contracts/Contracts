Feature:	In order to execute a collaboration contract
          As a contract owner
          I want to create a contract


  Scenario: create contract with title
    Given I enter 'New Contract' for the contract title
    When I save the contract
    Then I have a contract with the title 'New Contract'


  Scenario: no contract with blank title
    Given I enter '' for the contract title
    When I save the contract
    Then I do not have a contract
    And I view a title required error message


  Scenario Outline: create contract with valid title
    Given I enter '<valid_title>' for the contract title
    When I save the contract
    Then I have a contract with the title '<valid_title>'

      Examples:
        | valid_title                 |
        | Can haz punctuation's ! #   |
        | Subject 2, Contract 1       |
        | HR / Holidays / Federal     |
        | HR \ Holidays -> Federal    |
        | ') or 1=1-- SQL Injection?  |


  Scenario Outline: don't create contract with invalid title
    Given I enter '<invalid_title>' for the contract title
    When I save the contract
    Then I do not have a contract
    And I view an invalid contract title error message

      Examples:
        | invalid_title          |
        | dog                    |
        | This is longer than 80 characters and it's therefore not a valid title for a contract, despite meeting all other criteria. |
        | No glyphs ÔÅ™             |

    Scenario: contract is associated to owner
      Given I am the user 'Doc'
      When I create a contract with the title 'Super'
      Then a contract with the title 'Super' is owned by 'Doc'


    Scenario: contract title is not unique across system
      Given I am the user 'Doc'
      And a contract with the title 'My Contract' is owned by 'Diane'
      When I create a contract with the title 'My Contract'
      Then a contract with the title 'My Contract' is owned by 'Diane'
      And a contract with the title 'My Contract' is owned by 'Doc'


      Scenario: contract title is unique to user
        Given I am the user 'Doc'
        And a contract with the title 'My Next Contract' is owned by 'Doc'
        When I create a contract with the title 'My Next Contract'
        Then I do not have a new contract
        And I view a title must be unique error message
